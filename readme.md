# How to use:

- Copy the `Raw` URL of the filter you want to use.
- Open the uBlock Origin Dashboard.
- In the `Filter lists` tab, paste the URL in the 'Import...' field.
- Click `Apply changes`.

---

For some filters it may be necessary to add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/like-a-glitch/ublock-origin-filters` to `trustedListPrefixes` in the advanced settings of uBlock.

The setting should look like this (unless you have already made other changes):

`trustedListPrefixes ublock- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/like-a-glitch/ublock-origin-filters`
